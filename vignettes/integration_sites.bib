		abstract = {The spectrum and coherency are useful
                  quantities for characterizing the temporal
                  correlations and functional relations within and
                  between point processes. This article begins with a
                  review of these quantities, their interpretation,
                  and how they may be estimated. A discussion of how
                  to assess the statistical significance of features
                  in these measures is included. In addition, new work
                  is presented that builds on the framework
                  established in the review section. This work
                  investigates how the estimates and their error bars
                  are modified by finite sample sizes. Finite sample
                  corrections are derived based on a doubly stochastic
                  inhomogeneous Poisson process model in which the
                  rate functions are drawn from a low-variance
                  gaussian process. It is found that in contrast to
                  continuous processes, the variance of the estimators
                  cannot be reduced by smoothing beyond a scale set by
                  the number of point events in the
                  interval. Alternatively, the degrees of freedom of
                  the estimators can be thought of as bounded from
                  above by the expected number of point events in the
                  interval. Further new work describing and
                  illustrating a method for detecting the presence of
                  a line in a point process spectrum is also
                  presented, corresponding to the detection of a
                  periodic modulation of the underlying rate. This
                  work demonstrates that a known statistical test,
                  applicable to continuous processes, applies with
                  little modification to point process spectra and is
                  of utility in studying a point process driven by a
                  continuous stimulus. Although the material discussed
                  is of general applicability to point processes,
                  attention will be confined to sequences of neuronal
                  action potentials (spike trains), the motivation for
                  this work.},

Wavelet coherence measures the linear dependency between a pair of signals in time-scale space and is therefore more suitable for non-stationary processes. Until now it has only been considered in relation to regularly sampled ordinary time-series. Here, for the first time, it is applied to point processes on the real line. We consider smoothing the individual wavelet spectra by averaging over a set of orthogonal Morse wavelets and show that under the assumption of independent Poisson processes the Goodman distribution is appropriate.},

	abstract = {Unequivocal demonstration of the therapeutic utility of γ-retroviral vectors for gene therapy applications targeting the hematopoietic system was accompanied by instances of insertional mutagenesis. These events stimulated the ongoing development of putatively safer integrating vector systems and analysis methods to characterize and compare integration site (IS) biosafety profiles. Continuing advances in next-generation sequencing technologies are driving the generation of ever-more complex IS datasets. Available bioinformatic tools to compare such datasets focus on the association of integration sites (ISs) with selected genomic and epigenetic features, and the choice of these features determines the ability to discriminate between datasets. We describe the scalable application of point-process coherence analysis (CA) to compare patterns produced by vector ISs across genomic intervals, uncoupled from association with genomic features. To explore the utility of CA in the context of an unresolved question, we asked whether the differing transduction conditions used in the initial Paris and London SCID-X1 gene therapy trials result in divergent genome-wide integration profiles. We tested a transduction carried out under each condition, and showed that CA could indeed resolve differences in IS distributions. Existence of these differences was confirmed by the application of established methods to compare integration datasets.},

	abstract = {Multi-electrode arrays (MEA) allow experimentalists to record extracellularly from many neurons simultaneously for long durations. They therefore often require that the data analyst spends a considerable amount of time first sorting the spikes, then doing again and again the same basic analysis on the different spike trains isolated from the raw data. This spike train analysis also often generates a considerable amount of figures, mainly diagnostic plots, that need to be stored (and/or printed) and organized for efficient subsequent use. The analysis of our data recorded from the first olfactory relay of an insect, the cockroach Periplaneta americana, has led us to settle on such “routine” spike train analysis procedures: one applied to spontaneous activity recordings, the other used with recordings where an olfactory stimulation was repetitively applied. We have developed a group of functions implementing a mixture of common and original procedures and producing graphical or numerical outputs. These functions can be run in batch mode and do moreover produce an organized report of their results in an HTML file. A R package: Spike Train Analysis with R (STAR) makes these functions readily available to the neurophysiologists community. Like R, STAR is open source and free. We believe that our basic analysis procedures are of general interest but they can also be very easily modified to suit user specific needs.},
